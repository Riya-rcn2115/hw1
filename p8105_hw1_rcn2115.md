# Problem 1

\#Loading the dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Description of the dataset

This dataset contains the measurements and characteristics of penguins
and includes variables like **species**, **island,bill_length_mm**,
**bill_depth_mm**, **flipper_length_mm**, **body_mass_g**, **sex** and
**year**.

This dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm

# Creating a scattterplot

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

# Problem 2

\#Creating a dataframe

``` r
hw1_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp=rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
    vec_factor= factor(c("low","medium","high","low","medium","high","low","medium","high","low"))
  )
print(hw1_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1     1.41  TRUE        A        low       
    ##  2    -0.129 FALSE       B        medium    
    ##  3     0.200 TRUE        C        high      
    ##  4     0.938 TRUE        D        low       
    ##  5    -1.29  FALSE       E        medium    
    ##  6    -0.162 FALSE       F        high      
    ##  7    -0.263 FALSE       G        low       
    ##  8     0.866 TRUE        H        medium    
    ##  9     1.09  TRUE        I        high      
    ## 10    -0.967 FALSE       J        low

\#Taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe

This works and gives the mean of the numeric vector.

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.1698136

This works since the logical vector is treated as numeric (TRUE = 1 and
FALSE = 0).

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

This does not work as characters cannot be averaged.

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This does not work as factors need to be converted to numeric before
their mean can be calculated.

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

# Converting logical, character, and factor variables to numeric

``` r
converted_vec_logical = as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_logical)
converted_vec_char = as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_char)
converted_vec_factor = as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_factor)
```

The **logical** values are converted to numerical values (1 and 0). TRUE
becomes 1 and FALSE becomes 0. This explains why we get the mean for
these values.

The **character** variable conversion gives a warning ( Warning: NAs
introduced by coercion). This explains why we get “NA” when we try to
take the mean.

The **factor** levels (non-numeric) are assigned integral values. This
explains why we can get the mean for these values.
